# Map Manager Mapbox - Alpha Release

## Short Description

A powerful Flutter package providing an intuitive abstraction layer over mapbox_maps_flutter with mode-based architecture, real-time tracking, smooth animations, and advanced route management.

## Detailed Description

Map Manager Mapbox simplifies complex mapping functionality through a clean, mode-based architecture. Perfect for navigation apps, delivery tracking, location selection, and route visualization. Features smooth 60fps animations, intelligent route management, real-time GPS tracking, and comprehensive testing utilities.

## Key Features for Alpha v0.0.1

### ✅ Currently Supported

- **4 Operational Modes**: Basic, Location Selection, Route Display, Real-time Tracking
- **Smooth Animations**: 60fps location tracking with optimized coordinate manipulation
- **Smart Route Management**: Dynamic route shrinking and off-route handling
- **Location Simulation**: Built-in GPS simulator for testing and development
- **Type-Safe API**: Pattern matching and mode-specific handlers
- **Performance Optimized**: Queue-based processing and frame-rate control
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in debugging and monitoring

### 🎯 Tracking Mode Highlights (Flagship Feature)

- Real-time GPS tracking with smooth marker animations
- Intelligent route progression (removes traversed segments)
- Automatic off-route detection and detour visualization
- Queue-based location processing for consistent performance
- Customizable animation curves and timing

### 📱 Use Cases

- **Navigation Apps**: Real-time turn-by-turn tracking
- **Delivery/Rideshare**: Live tracking and route optimization
- **Location Services**: Interactive point selection and management
- **Route Planning**: Static route visualization and waypoint management
- **Fleet Management**: Multi-vehicle tracking (single route in alpha)

### 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

- **Clean Separation**: Mode-based design isolates functionality
- **Easy Integration**: Drop-in replacement for basic mapbox implementations
- **Extensible**: Simple to add custom modes and behaviors
